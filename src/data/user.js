			"As a current Product Manager and Full Stack Developer at the Dali Lab, I have spent the past several years honing my technical skills through developing and designing web applications for clients. I have taken the lead in mentoring students in the lab by offering React and Figma workshops. Outside of the Dali Lab, I look to improve the technology on campus wherever I can. I serve as a Designer and Developer on Trailhead, Dartmouth’s outdoor trip platform, where I improve trip sign-ups, browsing, and creation. In my free time, I love to ski, run, bike, hike, and play tennis :)",
